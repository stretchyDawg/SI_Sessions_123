MINECRAFT: REMASTERED ASSIGNMENT
In the game Minecraft there are players that can place and break blocks. They also have an inventory 
that can store items (items like blocks or weapons or materials, etc…). If you remember correctly, 
there are 36 slots in the inventory and each slot can only hold 64 items (except for some items, for 
this assignment weapons and armor can only hold one slot, the rest hold 64). 

There are also passive mobs (animals, etc…) that be killed by the player and hostile mobs that can 
kill or be killed by the player. Also, certain mobs deal different types of damage, (zombies deal melee, 
skeletons deal ranged, creepers deal explosive, etc…). Also if a mob is killed it drops certain items.

The player can be killed and can damage things. If it is killed it drops all of its items. It can deal 
melee, ranged and explosive damage just like the mobs, but that depends on the weapon its holding (swords 
deal melee, bows ranged, TNT explosive). The player can also wear armor, which reduces the amount of 
damage it receives
