1.1: SET THEORY - UNION
Given two sets, write a function that returns the union of
those two sets.

1.2: SET THEORY - INTERSECTION
Given two sets, write a function that returns the intersection of
those two sets.


2: WORDS BY THE LETTER 
Create a function words_by_the_letter(a_string) that takes in a string. 
Return a dictionary that, given a letter as a key, returns some 
collection of the words in the string that BEGIN with that letter. 

For example, given:
a_string: "SI stands for Supplemental Instruction"

The function would return:
"s" : "SI", "stands", "Supplemental"
"f" : "for"
"i" : "Instruction"


3: WORD DICTIONARY
Given a filename to a text file, return a dictionary of each 
word and its word count in this key/value form:
{Word : Word Count}

The words are NOT case sensitive (i.e. 'The' and 'the' are the
same thing.)


4: HIGHEST GRADE
Write a Python function that takes in a list of tuples, 
where each tuple represents a student's name and their 
final grade in a course. The function should return the 
name of the student with the highest grade. 

For example, if the input list is: 
[('Abe', 85), ('Alice', 92), ('Christian', 77)]

The function should return 'Alice'.


5: BOOK GENRE SEARCH
Write a Python function that takes in a list of tuples 
representing books in this form: 
(name, author, genre)

Given a genre, the function should return a collection of 
unique books of that genre (which is passed to the function 
as a parameter).


6.1: COMMUNE SKILL ASSIGNMENT
Iterate through a CSV file of workers in a commune in this form:
name, age, skill1, skill2, skill3, proficiency

Return a collection of tuples of workers in this form:
(name, age, proficiency, collection of skills)
MUST BE EXACTLY IN THIS FORM ^

6.2: COMMUNE JOB ASSIGNMENT 
Given this collection of tuples, return a dictionary
representing workers in this form:
{proficiency : collection of workers (as tuples)}
