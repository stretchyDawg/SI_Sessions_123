1: A pancake is a food (..duh). There are multiple types on pancakes (chocolate chip, blueberry, raspberry, 
etc...). Pancakes also have a weight (in lbs) and a price (in $). A pancake is less than another pancake if 
its weight is less than the other pancake's weight. If their weight is the same then order them alphabetically. 
Pancakes should be able to be put in setsâ€¦ (if you are confused on what this means then ask your peers or the 
SIs for some help).

Make a few global variable pancakes, here are some examples:
PLAIN_PANCAKE = Pancake(<insert your parameters here>)   
BLUEBERRY_PANCAKE = Pancake(...)
RASPBERRY_PANCAKE = Pancake(...)
NUTELLA_PANCAKE = Pancake(...)
...

When making your pancakes, follow some standards when making prices (this is required for #4):
Plain Pancake: $2.50
Blueberry Pancake: $3.00
Mini Pancake: $1.50
Nutella Pancake: $5.50
Any other pancake: $4.00

If these examples are confusing feel free to ask for clarification.

2: An Order contains the pancakes requested and the amount of pancakes requested. For example, an order should be able to 
articulate that 2 Chocolate Chip Pancakes and 1 Blueberry Pancake is requested. 

Find a data structure to represent this. You can pass in this data structure in the main function, (say you used a list, 
you can just pass in the list representing the pancakes in the main function). If it helps, you can manually test it in 
the main function, or if you wanna get crazy then make some unit tests! 

Requirements:
- There should be a method that returns the total price of the order 
- There should be a method that returns the total weight. 
- There should be a getter for the pancakes and the amount of pancakes requested.
- There should be a __str__ method that returns the data in this format:
    1 x Blueberry Pancake
    2 x Raspberry Pancake
    Total cost: <amount>lbs

3: A Pancakeria is a restaurant that takes in orders. They take in orders in first-come-first-serve manner. They serve pancakes in an 'eatable' fashion. 
Pancakes are eaten from the top down. After creating your __init__ function, provide these functionalities:
- A take_order method that... takes an order (adds it to the first-come-first-serve line).
- A serve pancake method that takes the order next in line and returns the pancakes requested from the order
  next in line in an 'eatable' fashion (pancakes are eaten from the top down)
- A print_next_order method that prints the next order in this format:

4: The local elementary school is having a Pancake party! They have a LOT of orders to make (10!), and instead of sending in 
their orders in a traditional fashion, they're sending their order as one submission in as a csv file in this format:

amount,type,weight
3,Plain,1.23
4,Plain,3.42
2,Blueberry,5.67
5,Nutella,1.23
6,Plain,4.75
1,Mini,24.9
2,Blueberry,1.2
3,Plain,6.8
1,Rainbow,3.4
4,Plain,5.6
(for testing, i recommend you copy this and make a order.csv file)

Note the pricing standards set in question #1:
Plain Pancake: $2.50
Blueberry Pancake: $3.00
Mini Pancake: $1.50
Nutella Pancake: $5.50
Any other pancake: $4.00

print in this format (assuming you have the correct __str__ method for the Order class):
