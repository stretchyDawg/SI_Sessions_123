1: A pancake is a food (..duh). There are multiple types on pancakes (chocolate chip, blueberry, raspberry, 
etc...). Pancakes also have a weight (in lbs) and a price (in $). A pancake is less than another pancake if 
its weight is less than the other pancake's weight. If their weight is the same then order them alphabetically. 
Pancakes should be able to be put in setsâ€¦ (if you are confused on what this means then ask your peers or the 
SIs for some help).

Make a few global variable pancakes, here are some examples:
PLAIN_PANCAKE = Pancake(<insert your parameters here>)   
BLUEBERRY_PANCAKE = Pancake(...)
RASPBERRY_PANCAKE = Pancake(...)
NUTELLA_PANCAKE = Pancake(...)
If these examples are confusing feel free to ask for clarification.
