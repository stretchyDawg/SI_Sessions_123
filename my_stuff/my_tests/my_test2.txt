1: MAKE FILE UPPERCASE (Strings & Files):
Make a function that iterates through a file (with both lowercase and uppercase characters).
Print that file but with all of the letters uppercase. (Assume there will be no errors in this question).

2: ARRAY SUM (Recursion & Arrays):
Using a recursive function that takes an array of ints as a parameter, return the sum of all of the ints.
Do NOT use loops.  (Assume there will be no errors in this question).

3: CSV CALCULATOR (CSV Files):
A csv organized text file named stuff.txt is organized as described:
operation,value1,value2 
Iterate through the file, and perform the operation described in the first field on the two values. There are ONLY 4 valid operations, +, -, *, /, and they can be performed on float or int data types only. 
HANDLE ALL ERRORS!!!!

4: ARRAY OF DATA (Arrays and CSV Files):
A csv file is organized as described:
Line 1: student_name,passed_test_1,passed_test_2,passed_test_3,passed_test_4
Line 2: bruce,false,true,true,false
Line 3: bobby,true,false,true,false
Etcâ€¦
Create a function that, given a filename and a test number (1-4) as parameters, returns an array of all the student names that passed. 
Then, make a main file that prints every student in that array, and print the amount of students that have passed the exam passed in as a parameter.
