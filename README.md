# GCIS-123 SI Session Repo
## If you are a fellow SI, and you have completed GCIS-123/CS1/any other intro programming course you can use this repository for your own benefit. 

My personal repository used for conducting my SI Sessions (also with old stuff from when I was Abe's student).
This repo has old session activities, session projects (spotify), and my own mock test questions.
