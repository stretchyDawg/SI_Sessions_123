Spotify Assignment REMASTERED
@ChristianMorgado Spring Semester 23

PROMPTS (what I will send them in the discord):
Using your knowledge of lists and tuples, you will be programming Spotify in Python!
Heres what you have to do:
-	1: Create an implementation of a song entry represented by a data structure. To do this you will make a create_song() function. We will discuss the parameters!
-	2: Create an implementation of a playlist, which is a collection of songs. When you first create a playlist, you must insert 3 songs. To do this you will make a create_playlist() function.
-	3.1: For the playlist, create an add_song(playlist, song) function that adds a given song to a given playlist.
-	3.2: For the playlist, create a remove_song(playlist, index) function that removes a song at a given index from a given playlist.
-	4: For the playlist, make a get_runtime(playlist) function that returns the total runtime of a given playlist.
-	5: For the playlist, create a search(playlist, name) function that searches for a song, given its name, in a given playlist. Return a Boolean representing if its found or not.
-	6: Create an implementation for a user represented by a data structure. A users properties consists of a name and a collection of playlists. To do this you will make a create_user(name, playlists) function.
-	7.1: For the user, create an add_playlist(user, playlist) function that adds a given playlist to a given users collection of playlists.
-	7.2: For the user, create a remove_playlist(user, index) function that removes a playlist at a given index in a given users collection of playlists.
-	8: For the user, create an artist_count(user, given_artist) function that finds the amount of songs by a given artist in a given users collection of playlists.  
-	9: For the playlist, make a shuffle(playlist) function that shuffles the order of the songs of a given playlist. (MAY SKIP)
-	10: Create a print_user(user) function that prints a users name and playlists in this format:
        Name: <name>
        Playlist 1:
        Playlist 2:
        â€¦
