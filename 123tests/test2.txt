1. Create a new Python module named "practicum" and define a function named 
   "count_letters" that declares parameters for two strings.

   Your function should count the number of times that each letter in the first 
   string appears in the second. Your function should match both upper and 
   lowercase letters. You may assume that each letter appears only once in the 
   first string.

   For example, given the strings "aeiou" and "Abraham Lincoln" your function 
   should return 5 because the letter "a" appears 3 times, "i" appears 1 time, 
   and "o" appears one time: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.

   Use the provided pytest unit test to test your code.

   HINT: you may find it very useful to write at least one helper function!

2. Take a moment to examine the "comics.csv" file that has been provided to you
   in the data directory. Note that the first line is a header with descriptive
   names for each column in the file.

   Define a function named "count_comics" in the practicum module. It should 
   declare parameters for a filename and a creator. The function should count 
   and return the number of comics in the CSV file that were created by the 
   specified creator.

   Note that most/all of the comics in the file list more than one creator 
   separated by "|". For example, "Gene Colan" is found in 
   "Stan Lee|Gene Colan|Richard Bache Ayers". Your function needs to be able to
   handle this.

   You do not need to worry about handling any errors on this problem. Use the 
   pytest unit test that has been provided to you to test your code.

3. Define a function named "make_array" in the practicum module. The function 
   should prompt the user to enter a size and then make an array of the 
   appropriate size. You may assume that the user enters a valid, non-negative
   integer. Use a loop to prompt the user to enter numeric values and store 
   the values in the array in the same order that they are entered. If the user
   enters a non-numeric value, print an error message and continue prompting 
   them until they have entered enough values to fill the array.

   The function should RETURN the array.

   You WILL NOT use the provided pytest unit test to test this function. 
   Instead, define a main function and use it to manually test your make_array 
   function. You should print the array that is returned by the function. Of 
   course the values that the user enters will change from one run to the next,
   but you should otherwise try to match the output below as closely as 
   possible.

   enter size: 5
   enter value: 12.34
   enter value: 3.14159
   enter value: a
   a is not a numeric value. Try again.
   enter value: "123"
   "123" is not a numeric value. Try again.
   enter value: 123
   enter value: -47
   enter value: 12.6
   [12.34, 3.14159, 123.0, -47.0, 12.6]

4. Define a function named "array_sum" that declares parameters for an array, a
   start index, and an end index. Use recursion to implement the following 
   formula to compute the sum of the values in an array:

      S(A, start, end) = 0 when start > end
      S(A, start, end) = A[start] when start == end
      S(A, start, end) = S(A, start, mid) + S(A, mid+1, end)

   You should recall from implementing binary search that mid = (start + end) // 2

   DO NOT use a loop in your implementation. If you do so, you will not receive
   credit for this problem.

   Use the provided pytest unit test to test your implementation.
